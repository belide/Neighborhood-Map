## About this Project 
This project is a single-page application featuring a map of a neighborhood I'd would like to visit powered by the Google Map API. Additional functionality include: map markers to identify popular locations or places, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. This project implements third-party APIs that provide additional information about each of these locations This project uses some data from [Wikimedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) also.
